Subject: Product Growth Insights & Recommendations – Mock Data Review

Hi Sir/Madam,

I'm Rishi, a final year Btech undergrad at DTU. I’ve wrapped up the analysis of our simulated product datasets and wanted to highlight the key takeaways:

Key Product Insights:-
- Engagement remains healthy: latest DAU is 11 with a 7-day average near 9 and steady growth over the past month (+18% vs. prior 30-day window). Weekly feature usage is led by Dashboard, Notifications, and Automation, each with ~80% user adoption.
- Cohort retention is thin: Month+1 retention averages just 1.3%, with most cohorts tapering off after the first month.
- Feedback volume is trending upward, and the sentiment mix is predominantly positive (61% positive vs. 17% negative), with praise centered on automation gains and constructive notes about notification overload.

Risks / Blockers:-
- A 72% drop from account creation to first transaction shows the onboarding-to-value gap is still our highest-leverage bottleneck.
- Low early retention indicates users don’t consistently experience core value after sign-up, increasing acquisition burn.
- Notification fatigue surfaces in qualitative feedback; if unaddressed, it could erode our positive sentiment lead and hurt engagement.

Strategic Recommendations & Next Steps:-
1. First-transaction activation: Ship the guided checklist experiment to reduce post-signup confusion. Success = +10% relative lift in first transactions within 48 hours; secondary metrics include time-to-value and support ticket volume.
2. Notification tuning: Prioritize a sprint on batching/muting options and sentiment tracking. Watch negative sentiment share to ensure it trends below 10%.
3. Retention-focused onboarding: Fold identity/payment setup into registration, add contextual nudges, and monitor Month+1 retention plus repeat session rate for uplift.

Thanks & Regards
Rishi
